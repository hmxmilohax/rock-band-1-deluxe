## üì© Installing on Xbox 360

> RB1DX requires a modded Xbox 360 console (RGH/JTAG) in order to run.

### Install your copy of Rock Band 1 to the console's hard drive. This step is required.
* We recommend that you rename its default.xex to default_vanilla.xex, just as a backup in case you ever want to go back to vanilla.

    * You can do this via FTP or by putting the files on a USB drive and copying them using Aurora's file manager.
* Select Yes to overwrite the files if it asks you to.

### Before you launch the game for the first time, we recommend that you...

* Disable any title updates you may have for Rock Band 1 in Aurora.
    * Rock Band 1 Deluxe rolls the latest one into its installation.
    * If you've never played Rock Band 1 on your console, you don't need to do this.
* Clear your song cache.
    * In the dashboard, navigate to System Settings > Storage > Rock Band and delete the song cache.
* Clear your system cache.
    * In the dashboard, navigate to System Settings > Storage and press Y to clear the system cache.
