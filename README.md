## üì© Installing on [RPCS3](https://rpcs3.net/)

## üì© Installing on Xbox 360

**NOTE: You WILL need a HACKED/MODDED (RGH or JTAG) Xbox 360 in order to play this mod on console. We hope this is clear.**

  * In case anything goes wrong, we recommend that you **rename `default.xex` to `default_vanilla.xex`**.

* **Disable updates** for Rock Band 1 in Aurora. *Rock Band 1 Deluxe* rolls the latest one into its base installation.

* Download [**Rock Band 1 Deluxe**](https://nightly.link/hmxmilohax/rock-band-1-deluxe/workflows/build/main/RB1DX-Xbox.zip). 
  * **Copy the contents of it to where your copy of Rock Band 1 is installed** (we recommend using FTP to do so).
  * Select `Yes` to overwrite the files if it asks you to.

### ‚úÖ ***Rock Band 1 Deluxe is now installed!***

<br/>

***Sidenote:*** We also recommend **clearing your song cache**, as well as your **system cache**.
* *To clear your **song cache**, navigate to `System Settings > Storage > Rock Band 1` and delete the song cache.*
* *To clear your **system cache**, navigate to `System Settings > Storage` and press `Y` to clear the system cache.*
